## A1â”€â”€â”€â”€à­¨à§Žâ”€â”€â”€â”€Tiny Game | January 23rd 2025â”€â”€â”€â”€à­¨à§Žâ”€â”€â”€â”€

"Red Cell Rush" is a quirky pixelated platformer where players control a red blood cell navigating through organs to deliver blood. The concept evolved after much trial and errorâ€”from food-themed ideas inspired by Japanese street food and desserts like my original idea of a sushi-themed game, where a fish avoids becoming food, being scrapped due to its complexity. And then turning into an entirely new human-body themed concept and game. Honestly this idea came from an epiphany I got while watching Netflix and procrastinating the weekend before the deadline which helped me finalize the concept.
The game includes three organ-themed levels: Heart, Stomach, and Brain. These choices were partly influenced by what was easiest to draw with Pocket Platformerâ€™s limited tools and perhaps a little hunger while working on this assignment (hence the stomach). Each level is creatively designed to reflect the organâ€™s environment, such as the stomach level having acid and "poop" obstacles.

Developing the game wasnâ€™t without its struggles. Designing a human-body world in a pixelated style, creating obstacles, and getting familiar with Pocket Platformer under time pressure were overwhelming at times and had me stressing since we werenâ€™t really introduced to anything the week prior due to the power outage.
Despite the challenges, the game achieved a cohesive and fun thematic style. I focused heavily on visual aesthetics, because I really like working on atmospheric elements when it comes to designing stuff. However, over-prioritizing theme over gameplay left some areas for improvement, such as deeper level design, better player challenges, and excluding musical elements. Also, I couldâ€™ve created a much longer game.

To be honest "Red Cell Rush" kept a humoristic aspect in my opinion of being a cell dodging poop obstacles or viruses in the human body, I tried to mainly focus on an original idea and theme/environment for this assignment more than level design which is what Iâ€™m hoping to learn or get better at throughout this course. Hence why my game design for this is super-duper basic. I also may have stayed in vacation mode too long and procrastinated too much for this which is why I probably found it chaotic and the poor overall delivery.

During the playtest everyone loved the game and the thematic experience of it being the human body. However, signs were in the way of the experience or need to be more carefully placed. Players actually did find the game difficult although I thought it was overly simple which was a pleasant surprise.

## A2â”€â”€â”€â”€à­¨à§Žâ”€â”€â”€â”€Bootleg Flappy Bird | January 30th 2025â”€â”€â”€â”€à­¨à§Žâ”€â”€â”€â”€

Bootleg Fally bird was mainly inspired by the demo presented in class last week. I was mainly inspired to this when the teacher made a falling circle onto a box. It kind of dawned on me as I was zoning out from tiredness of lack of sleep due to staying up late the night prior doing Red Cell Rush. 

Neverthless, this small prototype was to test or get my hands dirty with Unity. Being a first timer this was a pretty big challenge trying to figure out how Unity works and all the different components were quite overwhelming I must say. I felt a Flappy Bird type game would be the perfect concept to understand collision, movement, camera and placement when it comes to Unity. Basically everything shown in the class. Again, remembering that this was mainly a test assignment, so not taking it too seriously and not "try-hard" too much doing this. I used it more as a discovery moment. 

The way I wanted to personalize this project a bit more and not make it a complete Flappy Bird copy was to draw inspiration by "Red Cell Rush" my previous assignment being themed around the human body and its functions. So, following that idea I just grabbed a funny image of a red blood cell from the internet and skin clipart images as the walls the user isn't supposed to touch. For some reason this semester a lot of my projects have revolved around the human body's components which is funny, so why not continue the theme? I didn't create my own images maybe because I was lazy but mostly because I didn't want to spend too much time on things outside of Unity for this mini test. Again, really just wanted to get to know the program more than focusing on making a visually and absolutely new game/creation. 

I would say Unity is interesting in how everything really has to be added and then modified through coding which might be a challenge for me in the future of this class since I'm not the best coder. Regardless I'm going to thug it out and hopefully learn to understand it more. I like how whatever I do in code it's immediately presented/compiled in Unity and how certain components are modular/modifiable within the app itself instead of having to go to VS Code and code it myself. 

Honestly, I would've loved to spend more time making the entire thing more of a game instead of an interactive "unfinished" looking creation. I must admit I have been swamped this week and may have waited too long to start this mini experimental assignment but at least I got something and learned something. I believe this also happened because peers told me how this is a highly experimental and unserious assignment which is why it is the way it is.

For the future of this course and my Unity path, I would want to explore more point systems, counters, state changes and work more on collision elements for future assignments when I will allocate myself more time. 

Main thing: Didn't want to create something crazy new because I wanted to spend most of my time getting familiar with Unity and it was also my first time coding in C# so might as well code a game that's somewhat easy to code.

## A3â”€â”€â”€â”€à­¨à§Žâ”€â”€â”€â”€Lonely Pong | February 5th 2025â”€â”€â”€â”€à­¨à§Žâ”€â”€â”€â”€


Yikes. This week was very hard in terms of finding inspiration or motivation to do much. Seasonal depression? Overwhelming life circumstances? Lack of sleep? Not sure... BUT! Nonetheless life goes on and here's what I came up with for this "mini" assignment. It might be a bit minimalistic but this can be explained with the challenging week I had and also in how Unity is still VERY new to me and I'm still mainly exploring the platform. 

While being shown the demo Pong game last week in class, I realized how it was a two player game. Knowing this, I thought "what if you don't have someone to play with?" You can't really play it otherwise if you're missing a player. Now with this issue I figured why not create a single player version of it? I know this already exists obviously but I'm still using these small assignments as a way of discovering Unity so, again like Bootleg Flappy I want to keep it simple. Hence, the creation of Lonely Pong. 

How did I make it "lonely" or in better words a single player game. I thought about the mobile game "Color Switch" in how it's super simple, single player and also involves a ball with platforms. So why not try to incorporate that circular movement within Pong? I went with the idea keep the cell(ball) within the boundaries of the vein(circular background). 

For the creation of this lonely game, I wanted to personalize it a bit and seeing how this semester I have an amazing human body/function/anatomy/cell theme going on I'm still going to pursue it. Also, having a theme helps me feel more inspired when creating these little games/simulations. Saying that, I decided to keep the same character I had for Bootleg Flappy because it's a circular shape and works perfectly for pong. For the platform I just grabbed an image from Google which is a spine clipart that fit perfectly for my game. Since this is purely and exploratory assignment I didn't want to waste too much time creating my own images and wanted to focus more on what Unity does. 

In terms of what I learned in this project would be dealing with pivot points to create that circular dynamic/path that the spine platform follows. I also learned how to import my own Scripts since the ones Unity were offering were to be frank, boring and didn't follow my "cellular" theme. I had fun dealing with bounds and collisions for either ball which in my case is the red cell and the spine platform. I would say dealing with speed, velocity, randomness, gravity and movement were more of a challenge in this assignment. It's definetely hard to get the right "feel" for player movement and for the ball. Learning how to balance difficulty and what the player can actually do to "win" is a new aspect in game design that I learned throughout this process which was a nice discovery. 

For the future, I would like to incorporate more screens/scenes but I'm still new to Unity so it's still a complex system for me to grasp and fully understand so maybe for the next assignment I'll try to dive deeper in scene managemet. I only know how to do an end one for now. I would also like to figure out how to increase the velocity of the ball overtime to make the game harder overtime and less boring.

Forgot to add and thought about it mid class, the spine image turning into a sprite for unity to read was a headache! I couldn't figure out how to make it read as a whole image and not just little parts. Had to figure out how the sprite editor worked and was a massive headache for me. Almost dropped the whole image itself because of how complicated it was since its not a square, circle, rectangle heart or a simple shape!!!

Main thing: This week was a tough one mentally, again didn't want to do anything too crazy within Unity because for one I don't know how, it's still very new to me and used this again as an exploratory thing. For two, I just wasn't in the right headspace to try many new things this time.

## A4â”€â”€â”€â”€à­¨à§Žâ”€â”€â”€â”€Bone Breaker | February 12th 2025â”€â”€â”€â”€à­¨à§Žâ”€â”€â”€â”€

Geez. Last week's lecture was so hard to follow I got lost so many times it was really exhausting, my code didn't even properly run or wasn't even the same thing the teacher was getting so it was a huge question mark week. With that in mind I had to really stick to basic stuff for this mini assignment just so that I could actually grasp what we actually did in class. I went the more artistic route with this prototype since I spent most of my time figuring out what the heck was covered. But to give it my own twist I just modified a lot of the visual elements as best as I could. 

So, going into this prototype I went in with the mindset of there's already so many versions of block breaker and it's such a well known game that it's super-or almost impossible to create a new unique spinnoff of it. With that I told myself why not just focus on a visual variation of the game since it's simple and I can still learn throughout the process the main mechanics of the whole game/concept. Now, knowing this I again followed my body/anatomy theme going on for this semester just because it's easier to come up with an idea when following a theme for me, I need some type of constraint or else my imagination runs wild. So, I wanted to deviate from the cell concept since the human body has a lot more to it and also for the sake of creativity and less repetition throughout my assignments. One of the first ideas that came to mind was something to do with bones since they do break in certain individual's lifetimes. Hence,  the name bone breaker because in theory the user uses a skull to follow the skeletal theme to break bones on the top of screen acting as the bricks. 

To make the game flow more intersting, I made it so that the bones have multiple "breaking" levels. In other words, meaning the player has to hit some of them multiple times in order to make the bones go away, or fully destroy them in simpler terms. I tried to also make the bounce factor different depending on where the skull touches the platform. For example, if the right side is hit it bounces at a different velocity and angle compared to if the player hits the center of the platform. 

Honestly, don't have much to say for this assignment unlike my other ones since I was really confused from last week's lecture and spent a really long time reviewing the content. I learned a lot about velocity, angles, scene switching and more about how sprites work. 

I would like to say I struggled mostly with scene management and figuring out how building and connecting scenes worked in Unity. It was such a painful process. Also, an equally painful process that I'm still not used to even after the last assignment "Lonely Pong" is importing my own sprites. It is such a tedious process! To make sure the colliders and rigid body to be perfectly on the imported sprite is COMPLICATED. Also, making sure to see how Unity reads the image itself and how it imports it depending on complex the image is. 

Main thing: Importing complicated sprites is crazy in Unity, velocity and angles are hard to understand. I hate coding. Had fun putting a more visual twist/feel to the project. I think the concept of Bone Breaker is kind of funny. I also like the milk carton platform because...you drink milk for better bones but the user is using it to break them! And it was really late I don't know my brain was fried.
