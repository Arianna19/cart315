## Tiny Game | January 23rd 2025

Brainstorm:
Themes:
-       Music                          - Funny/Stupid
-       Food                           - Environment related
-       Meaningful                     - What’s the message
-       Desert                         - Heaven VS hell
-       Story                          - Comedic
-       Nightmare/horror               - Takoyaki
Thought about making a food survival platformer game, since food was a recurrent theme in my brainstorming process. Or maybe I was just hungry? Maybe one about Japanese street food for thematic purposes. A cooking game could’ve also been an option. I wanted to make something funny and unserious because why not… The world is too serious anyways.

Conceptualization:
Ice cream or Takoyaki game? //Why those two I don’t know thought about my fav desert and snack
è Create a tiny game with 3 levels to clear containing obstacles
è Background could be Japan themed because I traveled there recently and mentally, I’m still there
§  Then I realized how ice cream makes no sense in a Japan themed game ish
§  SO instead, I said fuck that and thought of a sushi platformer game. Where the player is a fish trying not to become a sushi to be eaten.
·      THEN I realized how in the heck can I draw that in the given tools being so pixelated in the amount of time I have an entire underwater world Japan themed and a hook with a decent looking fish, so was like this is going to be crazy difficult and slept on it. I was too overwhelmed then.
è AFTER procrastinating a bit too much I COMPLETELY TRASHED the don’t become a sushi game concept.
è The weekend before the assignment I got an epiphany after watching a show on Netflix and finally decided to make a tiny human body themed platformer game.

Design and Idea:
-       Concept: Player is a red blood cell trying to make it to the designated organs to deliver blood
-       Each level is a different organ you need to get to as the red blood cell
§  3 levels: Heart, stomach and brain //Why those no idea? Mostly because they
were the easiest to draw in Pocket Platformer with the limited materials and my poor drawing skills. And again, maybe I was hungry which is why the stomach is in there again lol.
-       Objective was to make each map focused/themed as much as possible on the organ that needed to be reached. Ex: Stomach = acid and poop objects/obstacles.

Challenges:
-       Making a world that looks as if you’re in a human body was hard as hell especially in pixelated format
-       Took me forever to get decent looking organs even though it was just 3
-       Coming up with obstacles that the player has to face, or just like creating the entire course in general.
-       Getting familiar with Pocket Platformer in so little time had me stressing
-       Making each little map themed to its organ required a lot of creativity

Successes:
-       I feel that in the little time given I was able to make an overall cohesive thematic game (wtv that means)
-       I’m happy with the designs I’ve come up with in terms of the décor
-       I’m a person who likes decorating or making things somewhat pretty looking in terms of environment and tried really hard to do so with this new platform.
-       I think it’s a fun idea lol
-       Focused mainly on thematic aspects more than the player’s challenges or level design for this project

Fails:
-       Not the best level design and maybe not mentally stimulating for players
-       Could’ve made the game longer
-       Musical elements would’ve been nice
-       Over-focusing on the thematic elements made a less unique game in terms of level design and originality of a challenge for the players.

TEXT: 

"Red Cell Rush" is a quirky pixelated platformer where players control a red blood cell navigating through organs to deliver blood. The concept evolved after much trial and error—from food-themed ideas inspired by Japanese street food and desserts like my original idea of a sushi-themed game, where a fish avoids becoming food, being scrapped due to its complexity. And then turning into an entirely new human-body themed concept and game. Honestly this idea came from an epiphany I got while watching Netflix and procrastinating the weekend before the deadline which helped me finalize the concept.
The game includes three organ-themed levels: Heart, Stomach, and Brain. These choices were partly influenced by what was easiest to draw with Pocket Platformer’s limited tools and perhaps a little hunger while working on this assignment (hence the stomach). Each level is creatively designed to reflect the organ’s environment, such as the stomach level having acid and "poop" obstacles.

Developing the game wasn’t without its struggles. Designing a human-body world in a pixelated style, creating obstacles, and getting familiar with Pocket Platformer under time pressure were overwhelming at times and had me stressing since we weren’t really introduced to anything the week prior due to the power outage.
Despite the challenges, the game achieved a cohesive and fun thematic style. I focused heavily on visual aesthetics, because I really like working on atmospheric elements when it comes to designing stuff. However, over-prioritizing theme over gameplay left some areas for improvement, such as deeper level design, better player challenges, and excluding musical elements. Also, I could’ve created a much longer game.

To be honest "Red Cell Rush" kept a humoristic aspect in my opinion of being a cell dodging poop obstacles or viruses in the human body, I tried to mainly focus on an original idea and theme/environment for this assignment more than level design which is what I’m hoping to learn or get better at throughout this course. Hence why my game design for this is super-duper basic. I also may have stayed in vacation mode too long and procrastinated too much for this which is why I probably found it chaotic and the poor overall delivery.

During the playtest everyone loved the game and the thematic experience of it being the human body. However, signs were in the way of the experience or need to be more carefully placed. Players actually did find the game difficult although I thought it was overly simple which was a pleasant surprise.
