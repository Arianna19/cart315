## Tiny Game | January 23rd 2025

"Red Cell Rush" is a quirky pixelated platformer where players control a red blood cell navigating through organs to deliver blood. The concept evolved after much trial and error—from food-themed ideas inspired by Japanese street food and desserts like my original idea of a sushi-themed game, where a fish avoids becoming food, being scrapped due to its complexity. And then turning into an entirely new human-body themed concept and game. Honestly this idea came from an epiphany I got while watching Netflix and procrastinating the weekend before the deadline which helped me finalize the concept.
The game includes three organ-themed levels: Heart, Stomach, and Brain. These choices were partly influenced by what was easiest to draw with Pocket Platformer’s limited tools and perhaps a little hunger while working on this assignment (hence the stomach). Each level is creatively designed to reflect the organ’s environment, such as the stomach level having acid and "poop" obstacles.

Developing the game wasn’t without its struggles. Designing a human-body world in a pixelated style, creating obstacles, and getting familiar with Pocket Platformer under time pressure were overwhelming at times and had me stressing since we weren’t really introduced to anything the week prior due to the power outage.
Despite the challenges, the game achieved a cohesive and fun thematic style. I focused heavily on visual aesthetics, because I really like working on atmospheric elements when it comes to designing stuff. However, over-prioritizing theme over gameplay left some areas for improvement, such as deeper level design, better player challenges, and excluding musical elements. Also, I could’ve created a much longer game.

To be honest "Red Cell Rush" kept a humoristic aspect in my opinion of being a cell dodging poop obstacles or viruses in the human body, I tried to mainly focus on an original idea and theme/environment for this assignment more than level design which is what I’m hoping to learn or get better at throughout this course. Hence why my game design for this is super-duper basic. I also may have stayed in vacation mode too long and procrastinated too much for this which is why I probably found it chaotic and the poor overall delivery.

During the playtest everyone loved the game and the thematic experience of it being the human body. However, signs were in the way of the experience or need to be more carefully placed. Players actually did find the game difficult although I thought it was overly simple which was a pleasant surprise.
